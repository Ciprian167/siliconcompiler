# Example Yosys block RAM memory map file.
# The format for this file is documented at
# https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/passes/memory/memlib.md
# The content of this example is as follows:
#
# "abits" specifies the maximum number of address bits the memory might use
# "byte" specifies the memory word width;
# "widths" lists the number of different word widths that can map to this memory
# "cost" indicates the area cost of the RAM to yosys;
# "init" indicates if the RAM can be initialized at boot time;
# the "port" block describes how the memory's data port(s) are configured.
# there are several ways this can be done.  This example specifies a single
# read/write port for single-port RAM with a clock rising edge and a dedicated
# read enable signal.  Other setups are possible; see Yosys documentation for
# details
